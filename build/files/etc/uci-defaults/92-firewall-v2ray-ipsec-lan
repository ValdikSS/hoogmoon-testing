# Allow IPsec-encapsulated traffic on WAN interface
#
# This is a hack to make IPsec IKEv2 tunnel work as if it is a LAN interface.
# IPsec does not create additional interface, but instead all the packets
# are coming encapsulated from the virtual IP address from the same (WAN)
# interface after the connection.
# That's why apply firewall rules for incoming IPsec-encapsulated packets
# from WAN as if it is LAN.
#
# There are several ways to make it properly, such as XFRM network
# interface, but this version of OpenWrt includes slightly outdated
# strongSwan version which does not configure it all automatically.
# Don't bother for now. It works.
