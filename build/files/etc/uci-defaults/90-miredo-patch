# Miredo client script adds default route over Teredo network,
# which works fine with glibc since it follows gai.conf(5) configuration,
# sets low priority of Teredo 2001:: address and uses IPv4 if this is
# the only IPv6 address, even with default route.
#
# However, OpenWRT's musl doesn't seem to follow the same rules,
# and adding default route over Teredo does exactly that.
# Microsoft server doesn't have Teredo-to-real-IPv6 relay,
# that's why we're ending in broken IPv6 connectivity,
# which is an issue for many programs, including opkg.
